The SpaceX Launch Finder is a React-based web application developed for COMP6300 Assignment 3. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate key frontend development skills using modern JavaScript libraries, external web services, and component-based architecture.

This application allows users to:

View and search historical SpaceX launch missions via the public SpaceX API.

Filter launch results in real-time based on mission name.

Explore mission details including launch date, rocket used, success/failure status, mission description, and official webcast link.

Submit user feedback through a form that includes input elements and a submit button, fulfilling required user interaction criteria.

Review submitted feedback on a summary page, with persistence using browser localStorage so feedback remains visible after refresh.

The project showcases:

REST API integration

React Router for page navigation

Component reusability and props

Controlled form handling

Responsive and animated UI using custom CSS

This app is designed to be deployed using the platform GitHub and reflects best practices in single-page application development using React.
